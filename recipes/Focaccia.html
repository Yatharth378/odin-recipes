        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>In a small bowl, dissolve sugar and yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with flour; stir well to combine. Stir in additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all of the flour is absorbed.</p>
                <p>When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly for about 1 minute.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil.</p>
                <p>Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface; knead briefly.</p>
                <p>Pat or roll the dough into a sheet and place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Brush the dough with oil and sprinkle with salt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <p>Bake focaccia in preheated oven for 10 to 20 minutes, depending on desired crispness. If you like it moist and fluffy,</p>
                <p>then you'll have to wait just about 10 minutes. If you like it crunchier and darker in the outside, you may have to wait 20 minutes. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
